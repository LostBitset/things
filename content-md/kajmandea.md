# Kajmandea: A dialect of Mando'a with verb inflections and vowel harmony

> Note: This document contains IPA (Intergalactic Phonetic Alphabet) transcriptions. Please ensure your font/device supports this.

Everything about the Kajmandea language (and it's dominant orthography, Kajmandea Demalã), can be found in the following repo: [LostBitset/kajmandea](https://github.com/LostBitset/kajmandea). This is just a slightly cut down description of the language, all in one document. 

Kajmandea is not compatible with traditional Mando'a orthographies, and a system known as Kajmandea Demalã is used instead. The following basic transliterations are typically used, with all other sounds transliterated as their IPA equivalent:
| Sound (IPA) | Basic Transliteration |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| ʃ           | c                     |
| ʒ           | ç                     |
| ɪ           | y                     |
| ɔ           | õ                     |
| ə           | ã                     |

With all of that out of the way, here's how to speak Kajmandea. 

## Phonology: Consonants

The following consonant sound changes occur:
| Mando'a         | Kajmandea |
|-----------------|-----------|
| vh              | bj        |
| ch              | ç (ʒ)     |
| End of verb "r" | lã (lə)   |
| '               | Elide     |

Any h following a consonant or as the coda (ending) of a syllable, which usually indicates aspiration, is simply dropped. The exception here is vh, as it has it's own transformation. For example, cin vhetin becomes syn bjetin. Everything in the table is just a simple substitution (or deletion). For example, chaab ("fear") becomes çaab. 

## Phonology: Vowels and Vowel Harmony

The following vowels exist Kajmandea, divided into three groups participating in vowel harmony and a "neutral" group:
| Front | Front-lax | Back  | Neutral |
|-------|-----------|-------|---------|
| a     |           | õ (ɔ) |         |
| e     |           | o     | ã (ə)   |
| i     | y (ɪ)     | u     |         |

There are four rules that ensure vowel harmony:
- If a word contains only sounds from the bottom row, every vowel becomes y. An important exception is dipthongs. The word for "parent", buir, becomes buur, not byr. 
	- Example: purin becomes pyryn
- If the first vowel is a front vowel, all other non-neutral vowels are shifted to the front.
	- Example: ret'urcye mhi becomes retircje my
- If the first vowel is a back vowel, all other non-neutral vowels are shifted to the back.
	- Example: su cuy'gar becomes su kuugõr

## Grammar

Unlike traditional Mando'a, Kajmandea indicates tense, mood, and negation using verb inflections. There are two versions of these inflections, for the front and back vowel groups. It also makes no distinction between the ordinary positive conjugation of a verb and the infinitive form. This is called the normal form. For example, oyõlã means both "hunt" and "hunting". 

To conjugate a verb in a specific tense or mood, drop the ã from the normal form, and then use the following table:
| Tense/Mood  | Front | Back  | Example  | Ex. Meaning    |
|-------------|-------|-------|----------|----------------|
| Normal      |       |       | epalã    | eat or eating  |
| Past        | -atta | -otto | epalatta | ate            |
| Potential   | -akka | -okko | epalakka | can eat        |
| Necessative | -appi | -oppu | epalappi | must eat       |
| Inferential | -akki | -okku | epalakki | is said to eat |

To negate a verb, simply you just add an appropriate ending, without dropping any vowels:
| Tense/Mood  | Front | Back  | Example  | Ex. Meaning            |
|-------------|-------|-------|----------|------------------------|
| Negated     | ne    | no    | epalãne  | not eat or not eating  |

Conjugations are negated the same way, so "did not eat" would be epalattane. You can also chain conjugations, merging identical consonants, and dropping all but the first gemination. For example, "must have ate" would be epalattapi. Negation works the same way, so something as complex as "must not have been able to eat" is expressed by the single word epalattakapine. 

Lastly, to avoid messing with vowel harmony, the possessive prefix be' is unused, and replaced with the suffix b (which exists in Mando'a but is rarely used). For example, "bowl's color" (Mando'a: sal be'ya'gai) becomes sal yagaib. If it ends in a consonant, ãb is used instead. For example, "parent's sibling" (Mando'a: vod be'buir) becomes vod buurãb.
