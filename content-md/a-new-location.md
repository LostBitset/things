# A New Location (Just a small note)

This is just a note that this collection of written things has moved here (`lostbitset.github.io/things`) from it's original location as `forgottengensym.codeberg.page`. Codeberg and Codeberg pages are awesome, and it's not like they did anything wrong. I've just been consolidating everything into my GitHub. 

The old location is still up, and has a note about this change, but will not be updated and will not be maintained.
